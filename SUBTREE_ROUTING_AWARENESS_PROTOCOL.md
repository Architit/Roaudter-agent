# SUBTREE ROUTING AWARENESS PROTOCOL (V1.0.0)
**Phase:** 8.0 (The Awakening)
**Role:** Roaudter-agent (The Router)
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. OBJECTIVE
To enable the Router to distinguish between and target specific Sacred Organs (24 subtrees) for task execution and data retrieval.

## 2. THE 24 ROUTING TARGETS
The Router MUST recognize the following semantic addresses as isolated routing nodes:
`/map`, `/kit`, `/journal`, `/atlas`, `/chronolog`, `/log`, `/protocol`, `/contract`, `/mode`, `/core`, `/flow`, `/module`, `/tree`, `/architecture`, `/structure`, `/system`, `/ecosystem`, `/space`, `/surrounds`, `/territory`, `/matrix`, `/code`, `/gen`, `/GENESIS`.

## 3. ROUTING POLICY: POLICY_V3
When a task is received with an organ-specific context:
1. Verify if the target organ is materialized as a subtree.
2. Apply isolated synaptic weight profiles based on the organ's domain (Logic/Creative/Empathy).
3. Use the isolated `/journal` of the target subtree for experience logging.

## 4. CONSTRAINTS
- **No Monolithic Fallback:** Do not route to the root `LRPT` folder if an organ-specific subtree is expected.
- **Address Validation:** Use `SUBTREES_LOCK.md` as the canonical map for routing resolution.

## 5. VERIFICATION
Successful implementation requires passing the `test_isolated_organ_routing.py` suite (to be developed).
